# Commons Data Stewards Github Repo

**This document derived from March 5th, 2018 data steward conference call.**

## Introduction
- Short introduction to the [Data Commons](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bl2pLzjqXJLP2rpwXVuytx3HnCYRhZ7YBPEPOJz34Ak/edit)
- The KCs are described [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bl2pLzjqXJLP2rpwXVuytx3HnCYRhZ7YBPEPOJz34Ak/edit). See, in particular, KC7, which is [focused on indexing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19XnfSvzbVsM-z2ud4rOgpnKG9HrdpdDqLG0mQvzNDxM).
- There are many dimensions of the commons and at different levels of maturity
- It is recognized that much of this should be driven by usecases, and the DCPPC-  developers should be sharing these with the Data Stewards as soon as possible. Our use-case situation is complicated - we need to push forward in the meantime

## Purpose and approach
- We want this to be a partnership wrt role definition, how things change over time, how to make best use of resources
- We recognize that Push/pull models, protocols will change over time

## Agreement: for each data source we will record:
- Version
- Short manifest, preferably computable
- Point of contact (POC)
- Schema version
- Is this possible: Description for generation dataset in the manifest - how it would be re-generated and transferred to the full stacks if that POC turned into a pump
