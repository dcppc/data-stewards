# Commons Data Stewards Github Repo

** This document derived from March 5th, 2018 data steward conference call. **

## Introduction
- Short introduction to the Data Commons
- The KCs are described here.
- There are many dimensions of the commons and at different levels of maturity
- It is recognized that much of this should be driven by usecases, and the DCPPC-  developers should be sharing these with the Data Stewards as soon as possible. Our use-case situation is complicated - we need to push forward in the meantime
- Our github repo: 
  - https://github.com/dcppc/ 
  - https://github.com/dcppc/data-stewards

## Purpose and approach
- We want this to be a partnership wrt role definition, how things change over time, how to make best use of resources
- We recognize that Push/pull models, protocols will change over time

## Agreement
- The alliance site will be used to obtain GO associations 
- Items like 
- Pathogenicity
- Orthology/Conservation/Homologs schema 
- These are underway, we will develop a Request For Data (RFD)  for these items on GitHub

## Agreement: for each data source we will record:
- Version
- Short manifest, preferably computable
- Point of contact (POC)
- Schema version
- Is this possible: Description for generation dataset in the manifest - how it would be re-generated and transferred to the full stacks if that POC turned into a pump
